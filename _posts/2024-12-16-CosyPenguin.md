A short (approx 10 minutes) platformer game about finding christmas decorations lost under the snow. Made in 35 hours for the SoloDev Jam 6 for the theme "Under the Snow". 

This was a tough game jam to finish since I ended up rapidly getting a cold/flu that wouldn't stop getting worse. Although, I'm really happy that I submitted something for my first solo jam, even though I had to submit early and it felt somewhat incomplete.
