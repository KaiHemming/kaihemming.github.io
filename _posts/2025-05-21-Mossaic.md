A cosy, tile-based ecosystem building game. Completed for the Godot Wild Jam #79, a 2-week jam, with Michael Anderson/LesserKn0wn (Art & SFX). This Jam not only comes with a theme, but also 3 wildcards that are optional.

The goal of the game is to place different combinations of tiles and habitat tokens to make a diverse map, starting with only dirt and water. For example, placing dirt next to water, will make grass, on which you can make bees, which will convert nearby grass into wildflowers.

<h2>Theme and Wildcards</h2>

The theme for this jam was growing and we managed to implement all of the wildcards.
- The game can be played using only one hand.
- Different combinations of tiles and habitat tokens produce varied results.
- Exploration off the beaten path is rewarded - i.e., creating as diverse a landscape as possible.
